# Top-Trumps
A simple two player, 30 card top trumps game. (runs in the terminal window)

Currently only using one value from the player arrays (Magic). 
The game plays within the while loop, and checks player one's hand against player two's hand.
If a hand is a draw, the cards get put into a 'limbo' array.
The winner of the next hand then gets the cards in the limbo array.
the game end when one player holds all 30 cards
